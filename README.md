# AcousticBiosensingGPT
GPT fine tuned for acoustic biosensing information

Project based off of [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb7U32kXMB0) and [blog](https://nader.substack.com/p/supercharge-your-gpt-model-custom) by Nader Dabit. 
The project is the an example of an easy way to fine tune an LLM. This new personalized model can be continued to be fine tuned with more and more data related to acoustic biosensing.

The reason for the project was to make it easier to search up information. Rather than going into the papers which I have read I put the data I took notes on into jsonl format then fine tuned the GPT model with these.
